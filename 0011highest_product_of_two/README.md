# Highest Product of Two

### Problem

Write a function that accepts an array of integers and returns the largest number we can get by multiplying two of them. For example, for the array:

```
[-100, 2, 42, 100]
```

...We should get `42 * 100 = 4200`.


* **Prompt**. Does your solution work for negative numbers? For example, imagine the input `[-10, -10, 30, 1]`.

### Solution

#### Greedy Solution | O(n)

We can keep track of the "best minimum and maximum so far" to implement a linear-time greedy solution.
