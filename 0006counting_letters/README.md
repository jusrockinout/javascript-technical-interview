# Counting Letters

## Problem

Write a function that counts how many times each letter in a string occurs.

For example:

```
var letter_counts = count_letters("Example sentence");

console.log(letter_counts['e']); // 5
```

Your function should be case-insensitive. In other words, 'E' and 'e' should both increment the count for the letter 'e'.
