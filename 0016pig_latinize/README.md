# Pig Latinize

### Problem

Write a function that translates a text to Pig Latin.

In case you've never heard of this silly language, to translate a word from English to Pig Latin, you move the first letter to the end of the word, and then add _ay_. So, "fish" in Pig Latin is "ish-f-ay".

```
pig_latinize("fish"); // ishfay
pig_latinize("your car is very nice"); // ouryay arcay siay eryvay icenay
```
