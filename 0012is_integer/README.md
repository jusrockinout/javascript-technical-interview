# isInteger

### Problem

Sketch and, if time allows, implement a robust function that checks if a given string input is an integer and, if possible, parses it.

By _robust_, we mean that your function should intelligently handle common error cases, such as the user passing completely invalid string arguments (`"not a number at all"`); values that aren't integers (`"-Infinity"`); and such.

Don't use `parseInt`.
