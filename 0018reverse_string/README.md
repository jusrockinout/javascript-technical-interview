# Reverse String

### Problem

Write a function that returns the reverse of an input string. It should work thus:

```
reverse('foobar') // 'raboof'
```

### Hints

* Write down a string and do this by hand. Can you pseudocode what you just did?

### Solutions

#### Iterative Approach | O(n)

A simple solution is simply to use a `for` loop to read the input string from the back, and build a new string with each letter you find as you go. 

#### Array Solution

Another solution is to use the built-in `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods.
